# Codebase for sociedadecivil.pt

Sociedadecivil.pt is a website that aims to provide tools for the Portuguese civil society.

The spirit is that only by having a civil society that has access to knowledge and the abiltiy to understand the public service can we have an healthy democracy.

Therefore, we will try to retrieve such data and make it available in such a way that everyone can understand it, hopefuly increasing the transparency of the public service.

# Preferred Tech Stack

The idea is to develop several crawlers and what not data mining solutions... In any case, the preferred language is going to be Rust. As
for the front-end, for now, plain javascript, some SCSS and/or SASS and web sockets all the way. You have a problem with that feel free to
bring it up so it can be successfuly ignored.
